## About me
> Hello! My name is Felipe Lages Stefenoni, I graduated as a Graphic Designer at the Federal University of EspÃ­rito Santo. Iâ€™m passionate about the mix of design and technology. Thatâ€™s why I decided to specialise in these areas.
 
> Outside of work my hobbies include canoing, exploring new places with my friends, playing video games, drawing, watching anime and sci-fi movies, discovering new technologies and taking waaaaay too many photos of my cats, Ã”nix and Saphir.
